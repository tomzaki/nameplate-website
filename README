My personal website

 - Right now there's just some links to my online presence
 
 - In the future there are plans for server file access
   i.e. serving up content for downloading and streaming
 
 - Before any of that is added, I need to develop a secure
   php login script that accesses a MySQL database of
   usernames/passwords. That's still very much a work in
   progress
