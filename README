My personal website: http://www.tomzaki.com

 - Right now there's just some links to my online presence

 - CSS only supports chrome and webkit browsers, definitely
   need to either change the layout or find some hacks
   for Firefox, Safari, and IE.
 
 - In the future there are plans for server file access
   i.e. serving up content for downloading and streaming
 
 - Before any of the file sharing stuff is added, I need 
   to develop a secure php login script (possibly tapping
   into a MySQL database of usernames+passwords). 

 - The login script is still very much a work in progress.
   Look for updates in my test-code-website repo.
